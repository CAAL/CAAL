A web-based tool for modelling and verification of concurrent systems. Concurrent systems are modelled using the CCS language. Supports verification of Î¼-calculus formulas and other properties such as bisimilarity and deadlock. 

Try it!

A live demo of CAAL is available at [figz.dk/caal](http://figz.dk/caal)

Setup
-----------
All you need is [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.
Clone this repository and run the following commands in the root directory of the repository:
```bash
npm install
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd modules/ace
